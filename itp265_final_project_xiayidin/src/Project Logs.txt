Project Logs of Tony Ding's ITP265 Final Project

Thursday Afternoon 11/12/2020 — 2-hour coding session
•	Reviewed my old UML and started coding
•	Coded Person Class and FitnessClass Class, which are the two ultimate super Classes;
o		FitnessClass is an abstract Class because there’s no need to instantiate that Class in my program. All the FitnessClasses should be either PersonalTraining or GroupExercise.
•	Coded all the FitnessClass Inheritance hierarchy: PersonalTraining Class and GroupExercise Class, along with associated Enums (Difficulty and ClassType).
•	Coded all the Person hierarchy: Member Class, PaidMember Class, GuestCustomer Class, as well as Instructor Class;
•	Coded rentLocker Interface


Thursday Evening 11/12/2020 — 3-hour coding session
•	Updated Hand-Written UML Diagram
	o	Added FitnessCenter Class,
	o	Added UI Class
	o	Added MemberLogin Class
	o	Corrected the Classes that implement the rentLocker Interface
			Corrected from GuestCustomer to PaidMember
o		Changed some of the Classes’ names to make them more formal and easier to understand/predict what will the code do in that Class;
•	Incorporated Peer feedback into UML Diagram
o		Added another MemberLogin Class purely for reading and writing to member.txt file; 
o		Added a FitnessCenter Class in UML that’s solely for reading and writing to FitnessClass files, which are PersonalTraining.txt and GroupExercise;
			The files mentioned above haven’t been included in my code package yet because I haven’t started coding for reading and writing to files
o		Decided to utilize Map for members in MemberLogin instead of ArrayList, which was my initial thought and was suggested during peer review
•	I also found that it would probably be better to finish the CustomerMenu first and then start the coding for AdminMenu. Hence, I created a CustomerMenu Enum of Customers’ potential actions like login/create account/add a FitnessClass/drop a FitnessClass/view billing/quit. I might add more options to the menu, but right now I will stick to these. 


Early Friday Morning 11/13/2020 --- 4-hour coding session
•	Started coding of login/sign up/log out functionality and finished it
•	Setting up Manager Login Menu as well as Customer Login Menu; 
o		Incorporated some different, some similar functions; Manager will be able to add new classes to the file (write to PersonalTraining.txt) while customer can add themselves to the member list (write to memberInfo.txt)
•	Finished all the methods required for a fully functional Customer Menu and Manager Menu. The only thing not working is writing to file for PersonalTraining Class in Manager Menu


Friday Afternoon 11/13/2020 --- 1.5-hour coding session
•	Went to Kamryn’s OH on Friday afternoon, and she offered an idea for writing to Personal Training File, which is to use an ArrayList instead of a Map
•	Figured out how to write to Personal Training File correctly and addNewClass method is functional
•	Adjusted my Menu options to reflect the newly added features/methods.


Friday Evening 11/13/2020 --- 2-hour coding session
•	Finishing touch of final project
•	Fixed some minor bugs in my code
•	Added a password feature for accessing Manager’s Menu
•	Final Project coding part is 99% done.

Sunday Night 11/15/2020 --- 0.5-hour coding session
•	Fixed another error for reading the PersonalTraining.txt file
•	Improved code readability;
•	Project finished; Started with Design Document and Personal Reflection

Project Finished.
